I am working on using a Microsoft Kinect to identify where a tomato is is in real world using the depth map created by the kinect.

The arm that will be used to "pick" the tomato is made of Dynamixel AX-12A servos.

The program is run on an Nvidia Jetson TK1 that interfaces with the servos using a USB2AX.
